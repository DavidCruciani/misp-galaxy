      "description": "An adversary may breach or otherwise leverage a mobile network operator’s (MNO’s) roaming partners or their service partners to gain access to subscriber’s services or obtain information about that subscriber from their home network. Since these relationships are of a more trusted nature, end-to-end security is not necessarily used.\r\n\r\nAn adversary may use the trusted relationship with other mobile network operators and their related service providers such as roaming hubs, roaming partners, national partners, SMS service providers, lookup services to gain access to subscriber information at the subscriber’s home MNO. An adversary may take advantage of potentially weaker security at a roaming partner of a targeted MNO. The roaming MNO or their service partners could also be adversaries themselves. \r\n\r\nThese trusted relationships expose more interfaces to the roaming partner and their service providers than described in the related technique [FGT5029](/techniques/FGT5029). The information an adversary can obtain or modify about a subscriber and the subscriber’s activity depends on the specific location and assets compromised and additional techniques used. Information such as location, call records, messages, etc. are potentially obtained. Adversary use of additional techniques to compromise the VPLMN UPF (N9 endpoint) may result in direct compromise of user plane data. The adversary may generate queries using specially crafted messages as described in [FGT5029](/techniques/FGT5029) or obtain credentials and operate as an apparently authorized partner would to collect information. Depending on the roaming partner’s configuration, core functions may be directly exposed to service providers used by the roaming partner.",

This requires a UE profile that permits attaching to networks other than 5G.\r\n\r\nWhen the security profile in the UE allows connection to a less secure service, adversary denies service to 5G, bids down victim UE to less secure network (4G or 3G) with illegitimate signaling. Then the adversary bids down the UE to 2G network and orders the UE to transmit with no or weak encryption/integrity protection. However, note that 5G (Release 15 and later) supports an anti-bid-down feature: during the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedure, the network sends to the UE an “ABBA” parameter (Anti Bidding Down between Architectures), which indicates the security features that the network possesses. When this feature is enabled, the UE is not to attach to earlier generation networks.\r\n\r\nAlso known as downgrading, the bidding down enables the adversary to perform additional following techniques using over the air interfaces, such as eavesdropping of user SMS and voice calls, user data or signaling manipulation, and privacy breaches.

This gives the adversary access to all VMs and, if guest privileges are high enough, the host machine as well. Although few if any instances are known, experts consider VM escape to be the most serious threat to VM security.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a container may also create privileged access to Host file system or execution environment.\r\n\r\n5G deployments may include PNFs as well as VNFs.  VNFs may be deployed over Type1 or Type2 VMs or as Containers over guest OS, or over a VM.

          "#### Addendum Name: Network Elements\r\n##### Architecture Segments: User Plane, Control Plane, Roaming, Virtualization\r\n Adversaries may sniff network traffic to capture information about 5G environment, control and user plane data including authentication material, equipment identifiers.\r\n\r\nA compromise of network function (NF) supporting Service based (SBI), Non-Service Based (non-SBI), Roaming interfaces, and virtual network elements may allow an adversary to capture network traffic.  \r\n\r\n\r\n The following Network interfaces are in the scope of this technique addendum:\r\n\r\n1.\t“Non-SBI” (non-Service Based Interface) network interfaces are within 5G core and RAN, and between the RAN and the 5G Core (e.g. N2, N3, N4, Xn). \r\n\r\n2.\tSBI network interfaces are between core NFs within an operator network; they use REST APIs.\r\n\r\n3.\tRoaming and interconnect interfaces, including IPX, are between network operators (between SEPPs, or other interworking functions like AMF/MME (N26) and between UPFs (N9)).\r\n\r\nAn adversary with access to the non-SBI interfaces not using encryption can monitor traffic exchange and obtain UE information such as user identifiers, serving network identifiers, and location info. \r\n\r\nThe adversary with access to the SBI links, may eavesdrop signaling messages if TLS encryption is not enabled. This leads to disclosure of UE authentication and authorization information, and NF IP addresses and other topology information.\r\n\r\nThe adversary positioned on an IPX node may collect data over the N32 interface while a UE is roaming, if a SEPP has used encryption on some parts of the messages sent, or used a weak cipher for JWE encryption. Similarly, an adversary positioned on a SEPP can observe or easily decrypt signaling messages sent on the N32 interface.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the EPC interworking interface N26 for non-roaming is not encrypted, all subscriber signaling data may be exposed to adversary.\r\n\r\nAdversary may also use compromised virtualized network elements to (vSwitch/vRouter, Virtual Firewalls) to span traffic to a sniffing port for access to traffic flows and user/system data. In a virtualized environment access can be gained much more easily as the servers making up a function are more likely to be physically and virtually distributed and the SDN vSwitch would allow an adversary to fork IP packets flowing between hosts remotely much more easily. Such forking is very difficult to detect or prevent from within a 3GPP NF or VM, and adversaries may be able to read data in transit. \r\n\r\nAn adversary may utilize these observations for several follow-on techniques.\r\n\r\n",
          "#### Addendum Name: Fronthaul\r\n##### Architecture Segments: User Plane, Control Plane, Roaming, Virtualization\r\n Adversaries may sniff network traffic to capture information about fronthaul user plane.\r\n\r\nORAN Alliance has defined the open fronthaul interface which connects one O-DU to one or more O-RUs inside the gNB. The fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical layer functionalities between RU and DU, and to control RU operations from DU. ORAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting of the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation, inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink, and FFT and CP removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling, modulation, layer mapping, and resource element mapping. Fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages, User or U plane is used to carry user plane data, Synchronization or S plane is used to carry timing information and Management or M plane is used to carry management data.\r\n\r\nO-RAN fronthaul interface needs to implement strict performance requirements which includes very high throughput and very low latency. See clause 4.4 of [2]. Some security features may not be implemented by MNOs to meet those requirements and to reduce processing delay. Hence, Adversary on the Side (AoTS) attack on open fronthaul interface is possible which results in passive eavesdropping of U plane data. The adversary may use a simple sniffer device to monitor all U plane communications which is normally not encrypted at lower 3 layers (RLC, MAC and PHY). Confidentiality and integrity protection requirements are not specified by ORAN alliance for control, user and synchronization (CUS) planes, and those are mandatory for M plane. See clause 6.1 of [2] and clause 5.4 of [3].\r\n\r\nNote: The user plane data in PDCP and above layers remains encrypted on Fronthaul U plane and this eavesdrop attack will not impact any of those data unless PDCP security is also broken by the adversary.\r\n\r\n"

          "#### Addendum Name: Compromise Network Isolation\r\n##### Architecture Segments: OA&M, Virtualization, Network Slice\r\n An adversary may compromise network separation controls to gain access to one or more of the 5G security zones or networks.  \r\n\r\n5G is a system of systems and may be composed of several network and security zones, as well as slices.  A compromise of controls placed to maintain security zones or network segmentation based on IP networks, application groups or slices may allow an adversary to gain unauthorized access to networks or services. This may occur at a Core, RAN, Cloud or Slice boundary.\r\n\r\nOnce the adversary has infiltrated the internals of the network, it has ample opportunities and a much broader attack surface to explore. The adversary can, e.g., conduct privilege escalation and process injection for gaining administrative rights, attempt password cracking of valid user accounts on the nodes, exploit vulnerabilities in databases and file systems, and take advantage of improper configurations of routers and switches.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of a network and its security zones can exist between various technologies, such as 4G and 5G, or between different partners, such as private networks, mobile operators, or Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs). These boundaries can also exist between different network components, such as radio access, core, edge, and cloud, as well as between national or international links and operator cores, and service providers or operator cores.\r\nIn some cases, firewalls may be used to separate these zones, such as SS7 protocol, Diameter protocol, 5G APIs, enhanced SCP (Service Communication Proxy), IP (Internet Protocol), SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), and GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocols) firewalls. Alternatively, an interworking function may be used to translate one protocol into another. However, it's important to note that privileged access is not always necessary to bypass a firewall or exploit an interworking function. Often, insufficient filtering may be the cause, or the filtering may not be sufficiently deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical layer functionalities between RU and DU, and to control RU operations from DU. ORAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation, inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink, and FFT and CP removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling, modulation, layer mapping, and resource element mapping. Fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages, User or U plane is used to carry user plane data, Synchronization or S plane is used to carry timing information and Management or M plane is used to carry management data.\r\n\r\nO-RAN fronthaul interface needs to implement strict performance requirements which includes very high throughput and very low latency. See clause 4.4 of [2]. Some security features may not be implemented by MNOs to meet those requirements and to reduce processing delay. Hence, AiTM attack on open fronthaul interface is possible which results in manipulation of U plane data. The adversary may manipulate RLC and MAC layers of the user plane data to cause DoS attack and/or session redirection attack (e.g. DNS redirection) on legitimate subscribers. Confidentiality and integrity protection requirements are not specified by ORAN alliance for control, user and synchronization (CUS) planes, and those are mandatory for M plane. See clause 6.1 of [2] and clause 5.4 of [3].\r\n\r\nNote: The user plane data in PDCP and above layers remains integrity protected on Fronthaul U plane and this data manipulation attack will not impact any of those data unless PDCP security is also broken by the adversary.\r\n\r\n",
          "#### Addendum Name: Layer 2 Redirection of DNS Requests\r\n##### Architecture Segments: Control Plane, User Plane, Roaming\r\n An adversary can manipulate encrypted traffic to achieve redirection of DNS requests sent by the victim UE to the network over the radio interface.\r\n\r\nUsing a fake gNB and fake UE device, the adversary can modify DNS requests the UE sends over the air, even though they are encrypted, if the adversary knows the correct DNS address and there is no integrity protection on user plane data[1].  User plane integrity protections prevent this attack on typical 5G RAN links, however these protections are optional.  Alternatively, an adversary may have bid-down the UE as a precondition to achieve the effect.\r\n  \r\n",
          "#### Addendum Name: Network Interfaces\r\n##### Architecture Segments: Control Plane, User Plane, Roaming\r\n Adversary with access to a non-Service Based Interface (non-SBI) node or an SBI Network Function (NF), or a function on the roaming/interconnect interfaces, may manipulate or spoof user plane and control plane traffic on that interface without integrity protection, towards a DOS or other attacks on the UE or a NF.\r\n\r\nThe following Network interfaces are in the scope of this document.\r\n\r\n1. “Non-SBI” (non-Service Based Interface) network interfaces are within 5G core (e.g. N4) and RAN (e.g. Xn, F1, E1), and between the RAN and the 5G Core (e.g. N2, N3 interfaces). \r\n\r\n2. SBI network interfaces are between core NFs within an operator network; they use REST APIs.\r\n\r\n3. Roaming and interconnect interfaces, including IPX, are between network operators (between SEPPs (N32), between UPFs (N9), or interworking functions like between AMF and MME (N26)).\r\n\r\nUnlike radio communications, within operator RAN and from RAN to core communications do not always employ integrity protection as per standards. If the gNB does not provide integrity protection for control plane (CP) packets sent on the N2/Xn-C/F1-C/E1 interfaces or does not provide user plane (UP) integrity protection for user plane packets sent on the N3/Xn-U/F1-U interfaces, or UPF does not provide integrity protection for user plane packets sent on the N9 interface, then data manipulation (alteration of messages, insertion/spoofing of messages, or replay of legitimate signaling messages) is possible. This may result in DOS. \r\n\r\nThe adversary with access to the SBI links, for example, with control over a middlebox (not including the Service Communication Proxy or SCP), may manipulate or inject spoofed signaling messages if TLS integrity is not enabled or is using a weak algorithm.\r\n \r\nIf an IPX disables JWS signature or uses a weak algorithm for JWS signature, an AiTM may manipulate data over the N32 interface while a UE is roaming.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the EPC interworking interface N26 for non-roaming is not integrity protected, all subscriber signaling data may be manipulated by adversary. Refer clause 4.3.1 of [3].\r\n\r\n",
          "#### Addendum Name: Radio Interface\r\n##### Architecture Segments: RAN\r\n Adversary with access to radio interface manipulates user and control plane traffic received on that interface without integrity protection, for example to redirect traffic, or obtain location information of the UE.\r\n\r\nIf the gNB does not provide integrity for control plane or user plane packets on radio interfaces, then data manipulation (alteration of data frame content, insertion/spoofing of messages, or replay of old messages) is possible. \r\n\r\n"

If that assumption fails, malicious activity can take place.\r\n \r\nThe gNB is the termination point for encryption and integrity protection, if user plane traffic is sent in clear, it can potentially be exposed to an adversary controlling the gNodeB. \r\n\r\nO-RAN Architecture puts network intelligence and management capability in Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) framework, with Near-Real-Time Radio Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) and Non-Real-Time RIC (Non-RT RIC) that can change the network behavior. It further allows xApps and rApps with standard interfaces to agents (if configured) outside the controlled network that can also read data and send configuration changes.  A compromise of any of these components can potentially cause unintended changes to the network and expose user information.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnauthorized access to and manipulation of the gNB component can be carried out by a supply chain attack or as a result of malicious updates using operator’s management and deployment tools.

In shared RAN scenarios, the use of service configuration and management tools by multiple parties may increase the risk vectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n3GPP does not dictate deployment models, so it is possible that improper security hardening and separation of networks between RAN VNF and Core VNF in the same Cloud or MEC may further allow lateral movements of adversary if a gNodeB component is compromised.",

      "description": "An adversary may discover a valid GTP-U TEID in order to apply additional techniques.\r\n\r\nThe GPRS Tunneling Protocol - User plane (GTP-U) is a protocol in both 4G and 5G that tunnels user data packets between the radio network (gNB/eNB) and the User Plane Function (UPF) in 5G, Serving Gateway (SGW) in 4G. In 4G, there is another GTP-U tunnel between SGW and Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway (PGW). The GTP-U protocol header has a Tunnel Endpoint ID (TEID). Each UE is assigned a unique TEID for the GTP-U tunnel and it is used to carry data from multiple QoS flows. In order to apply additional techniques like hijacking the tunnel, the adversary needs to discover a valid TEID.\r\n\r\nAdversary may try to guess the TEID by sending a large number of encapsulated GTP-U packets to the UPF/PGW from the internet with different TEIDs, until a valid one is found. UPF/PGW forwards those packets to the UE through GTP-U tunnels. Following GTP-U tunnels are used: In 5G, N3 GTP-U tunnel between UPF and gNB, in 4G, S1-U GTP-U tunnel between SGW and eNB and S5 GTP-U tunnel between SGW and PGW. When target IP address and TEID match, the adversary may receive a response indicating success. Some core networks show affinity to certain ranges of TEIDs under certain conditions, making brute forcing easier.

From the sniffed paging messages, and adversary learns the “paging occasion” for that UE. From the paging occasion, several bits (7) of the IMSI can be deduced. The rest of the IMSI (24 bits) can be tried out by brute force by sending many paging messages (e.g. via a fake base station) corresponding to the IMSIs being tried out, and if one gets a response that is valid, it means that the guess is correct. \r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral UEs may end up sharing the same paging occasion. With knowledge of the victim’s phone number, an adversary can cause the victim UE to be paged in a certain fashion (e.g. by sending a given number of silent SMS and watching for a similar number of paging messages), the adversary can determine the paging occasion for that UE. If the UE is not located in that cell area, then no such paging messages will be noticed. An adversary needs to install sniffers in all of the cell areas of interest, i.e. where they desire to determine the presence or absence of a target UE at a given time, and/or to determine the UE identifiers (IMSI or SUPI or TMSI).\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground information: the IMSI in the US is ~49 bits, but the IMSI’s leading 18-bits (i.e., the mobile country code and the mobile network code) can be obtained from the phone number using paid, Internet-based home location register lookup services. The “paging occasion” – the precise time/frequency slot when the paging indication is sent—is calculated in a known way based on a UE identifier- either IMSI or TMSI.",

Adversaries can also manipulate the model itself during training, introducing hidden backdoor patterns (Backdoor Attacks) or deducing sensitive information by observing model outputs (Model Inversion Attacks). In the inference phase, they can create adversarial examples to trick the model (Adversarial Examples) or subtly change data distributions over time to cause incorrect predictions (Concept Drift). Additionally, adversaries can engage in data pollution by manipulating live input data (Data Poisoning in Live Systems) or compromise model integrity by stealing and manipulating training data (Data Theft). Lastly, they can attempt to determine training data membership via Membership Inference Attacks by querying the model with tailored inputs. \r\n\r\nThe ORAN implementation outlines the inclusion of a RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) and its associated xApps/rApps within the RAN system, which are designed for machine learning and optimization purposes. Machine learning models might also be present within the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) framework to enhance network design, deployment, and operation. However, any malicious alterations made to these ML models, or their associated data could lead to unintended consequences, such as disruptions in the desired operational state of network components, traffic management issues, and potentially even network outages.",

          "#### Addendum Name: Unauthorized device on O-RAN fronthaul infrastructure\r\n##### Architecture Segments: RAN, O-RAN\r\n An adversary may attach a device to an O-RAN fronthaul infrastructure in order to disrupt its traffic.\r\n\r\nIn an O-RAN architecture, the baseband unit (BBU) is divided into two components: the distributed unit (DU) and the centralized unit (CU). The front haul interface plays a crucial role in connecting the DU and the Remote Radio Unit (RU or RRU) within the network, ensuring efficient communication. \r\n\r\nTo transport the CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface) traffic from the RU to the DU, an Ethernet-based bridged network is employed. This involves utilizing various Ethernet protocols such as IEEE 802.3 for general Ethernet connectivity, IEEE 802.1 for bridging and VLAN tagging, and IEEE 802.1CM for time-sensitive networking in industrial automation. The Ethernet-based fronthaul interface establishes a high-capacity and low-latency connection between the DU and the RU, facilitating the efficient transmission of digital baseband data, synchronization signals, control signals, and management information. Usually, RUs and Ethernet Switches are placed near the antenna units, which are unmanned facilities and can be physically breached due to detection and response time delays by personnel. \r\n\r\nUnauthorized devices on this infrastructure can pose significant risks to the O-RAN network. Such devices can be used towards a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack by sending malicious or bogus messages, disrupting network operations. Additionally, they may attempt to eavesdrop on critical Control (C-Plane), User (U-Plane), Synchronization (S-Plane), or Management (M-Plane) traffic, compromising the confidentiality of the network.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
