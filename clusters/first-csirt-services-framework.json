      "description": "Purpose: Implement automated, continuous processing of a wide variety of information security event sources and contextual data in order to identify potential information security incidents, such as attacks, intrusions, data breaches or security policy violations.\nDescription: Based on logs, NetFlow data, IDS alerts, sensor networks, external sources, or other available information security event data, apply a range of methods from simple logic or pattern matching rules to the application of statistical models or machine learning in order to identify potential information security incidents. This can involve a vast amount of data and typically, but not necessarily, requires specialized tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or big data platforms to process. An important objective of continuous improvement is to minimize the amount of false alarms that need to be analyzed as part of the Analyzing service.\nOutcome: Potential information security incidents are identified for analysis as part of the Analyzing service.",

This may require manual or automated gathering of additional information, depending on the detection use case. Priority should be given to the analysis of potentially more critical information security incidents to ensure timely reaction to what is most important. Structured qualification of detected potential information security incidents enables effective continuous improvement in a directed way by identifying detection use cases, data sources, or processes with quality issues.\nOutcome: Qualified and correlated information security incidents are available as input to the Information Security Incident Management service area and false positives are qualified for continuous improvement.",

The CSIRT should anticipate that potential information security incidents may be reported from various sources in various formats, both manually and automatically.\nTo enable constituents to report information security incidents more effectively, the CSIRT should provide one or more mechanisms as well as guidance or instructions on what and how to securely report information security incidents. Reporting mechanisms can include email, a website, a dedicated information security incident reporting form or portal, or other appropriate methods to enable reports to be submitted safely and securely. Reporting guidance, if not included as part of an information security incidents reporting form itself, should be provided in separate documentation or via a webpage, and should list the specific information that is desirable for inclusion in the report.",

This applies to any formats and sources: hardware, firmware, memory, software, etc. Any artefact or evidence must be preserved and collected without any modification, and kept in isolation. As some artefacts and data may become evidence in the context of law enforcement activities, specific regulations or requirements may apply.\nEven without preserving a chain-of-custody, this service usually involves complex and time-consuming tasks, and requires expertise, setting up dedicated and monitored analysis environments--with or without external accesses from standard wired or wireless networks (such as performing the forensics activities in a sealed or Faraday room), logging of activities, and compliance with procedures.",

Even before a response plan can be finalized, ad-hoc measures may be taken. This service also includes the initiating and tracking of all activities which are performed until the information security incident can be considered closed or new information becomes available that requires further analysis and henceforth may also change the response strategy and plan.\nOutcome: The information security incident is mitigated and the cyber security posture is improved.

As some activities required for a successful mitigation and recovery might involve management approval, this requires suitable escalation and reporting functions established before any information security incident can be handled effectively and efficiently. As the CSIRT analyzes all information as it becomes available, coordination makes sure that notifications and information reach the right points of contact, track their responses and make sure that all parties carrying out activities report back to provide for accurate situational awareness until the information security incident is considered closed and requiring no further coordination.\nStakeholders should have avenues to submit questions, check the status of information security incidents, and report issues to the CSIRT. To engage internal stakeholders, the CSIRT should provide communications channels to advertise the remediation status of information security incidents. To engage external stakeholders, the CSIRT should maintain communications channels to other CSIRTs and CSIRT communities that might provide recommendations or technical support.",

But the response to a crisis is usually associated with an emergency that threatens the well-being of humans and society at large, or at least the existence of an organization. As it is established in crisis management, a high-ranking role will take over the responsibility of a crisis, thereby changing the usual line of command for the duration of the emergency.\nAs the systems and networks might contribute to emergencies or are required to be available to respond to a crisis situation, a CSIRT will usually be a critical resource for managing such situations and provide valuable experience but also the established services and networks of points of contacts.",

Functions and activities related to the passive receipt of new vulnerability information from someone else are described later in the Vulnerability Report Intake service. Occasionally a new vulnerability may be discovered by a CSIRT during other activities, such as while analyzing or investigating an incident report. Another means of learning of a new vulnerability is through reading public sources (e.g., websites, mailing lists6), other external sources (e.g., premium services, subscriptions), or by actively looking for vulnerabilities through deliberate research (e.g., through fuzz testing, reverse engineering). Such discoveries should be documented and fed into the organization’s vulnerability handling processes, regardless of how the CSIRT discovered or learned of the vulnerability.\nOutcome: This service results in an increased discovery of potential vulnerabilities that were not reported directly to the CSIRT.",

Analysis may reveal when events do not match typical expected behavior, or may reveal information about the circumstance, nature, or origin of events or behaviors. Analysis may reveal implications to current and future situations. For example: a system may log that a user ID successfully logged into the system, but the system does not indicate whether the event was performed by a legitimate user. New sources (such as interviews with the user) will need to be incorporated into the analysis to provide the team with a more accurate picture to determine the legitimacy of the event. A variety of techniques may be used to analyze and interpret the collected data and its effect upon the constituency.\nOutcome: A set of conclusions about the probable historical, current, and/or likely future events within a constituency is produced. It may also include recommendations about certain decisions that a constituency is facing. Analysis should be supported by evidence such as observation data collected from sensors and other sources and the interpretation of that evidence by analysts through a variety of methods.

Depending on the amount of detail and quality of the information provided in the initial report, it may or not be obvious whether a real information security incident has occurred or if there is a different reason—such as misconfiguration or hardware failure. The next step will be determined on the basis of the preliminary assessment (e.g., process the report for further analysis; seek additional information from the reporter or other sources; decide that the report needs no further action or is a false alarm).\nIt is possible that attacks may originate from within the constituency of a CSIRT, may target this constituency, or the constituency is affected by collateral effects only. If the CSIRT does not provide Information Security Management services for the identified targets, then the report should be forwarded securely to an external group for handling, such as the affected organization(s) or CSIRT(s).",

The observations from sensors that are used to detect events may be shared among multiple services.\nCSIRT teams also need to determine the current situational picture based upon specific pieces of information about threats. This activity may sometimes be called “threat hunting.” Typically, threat hunting involves either preparing the environment to detect specific threat activity, or searching for specific threat activity that may already be present.",

Certain responses to an incident may affect a situational picture differently, and responders may ask for analysis (e.g., impact, cost, risk of failure) of choices. The decision-making needs of the constituency may change as their situational picture evolves, and the CSIRT team may initiate new analysis processes to assist them. This activity is related to the Incident Management Service Area.
